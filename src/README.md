## Multivariate Recurrent GAN for generating time-series

This work is intended for extension into real-valued multivariate time series data in the biomedical field, contingent on the quality of generated results and robustness to masking perturbations.

A thorough development log can be found in `todos.md`.

Further developments underway :snail:

* points for readme:
* motivation for making RGAN; enrich and mix features and privatize existing medical data
* similar research papers to cite and mention
* add all code into src and keep basic description in first readme
