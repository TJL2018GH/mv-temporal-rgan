## Recurrent GAN for LFW faces

This is a test repository for realistic face generation using a recurrent GAN. This work is intended for extension into real-valued multivariate time series data in the biomedical field, contingent on the quality of generated results and robustness to masking perturbations.

Further developments underway :snail:
